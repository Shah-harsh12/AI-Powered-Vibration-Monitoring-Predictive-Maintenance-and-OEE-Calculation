# AI-Powered-Vibration-Monitoring-Predictive-Maintenance-and-OEE-Calculation
## **Project Description:**  
Industrial machinery often exhibits early warning signs before failure, such as abnormal vibration patterns, inconsistent performance, and reduced efficiency. To prevent unplanned downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and optimize equipment performance, this project leverages **Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to monitor vibration data, predict failures, and calculate **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).**  

### **Key Objectives:**  
1. **Vibration Monitoring & Anomaly Detection:**  
   - Analyze real-time vibration sensor data to detect unusual patterns.  
   - Train an ML model to identify potential equipment failures before they occur.  

2. **Predictive Maintenance:**  
   - Develop a predictive maintenance model that forecasts potential breakdowns.  
   - Enable proactive scheduling of maintenance activities, reducing downtime.  

3. **OEE Calculation & Prediction:**  
   - Compute OEE using **Availability, Performance, and Quality** metrics.  
   - Build a predictive model to estimate future OEE based on operational data.  

### **Implementation Approach:**  
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Utilize real-world datasets from sources like Kaggle to clean, preprocess, and prepare data for model training.  
- **Model Development:** Use ML algorithms such as **Random Forest, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, and Regression Models** to predict failures and OEE scores.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy using performance metrics like **F1-score, RMSE, and cross-validation.**  
- **Deployment & Integration:** Implement a **Flask/FastAPI-based API** to integrate with industrial IoT systems for real-time predictions. Optionally, develop a simple **web interface** for visualization.  

### **Expected Impact:**  
- **Reduce unplanned downtime** by accurately predicting machine failures.  
- **Optimize maintenance schedules** to lower operational costs.  
- **Improve production efficiency** by continuously monitoring OEE metrics.  

### **Technology Stack:**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow (optional), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask/FastAPI  
- **Deployment:** Local server, Heroku (optional)  

This project is designed to provide a **scalable, AI-driven solution for industrial equipment monitoring**, making manufacturing processes more **efficient, reliable, and cost-effective.**
