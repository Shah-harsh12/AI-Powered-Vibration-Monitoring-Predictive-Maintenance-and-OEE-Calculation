# AI-Powered-Vibration-Monitoring-Predictive-Maintenance-and-OEE-Calculation
This project leverages AI/ML to monitor industrial vibration data, predict failures, and calculate OEE. By detecting anomalies and forecasting maintenance needs, it reduces downtime, lowers costs, and optimizes performance, it enables real-time monitoring via a Flask/FastAPI-based API for seamless industrial integration.
